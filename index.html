                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-sky-700 mb-2">2. Core Philosophy & Approach (from Report)</h3>
                <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-2">This roadmap is predicated on the understanding that Mathematics provides the bedrock upon which both AI and modern Quantitative Finance are built. A robust mathematical foundation is, therefore, indispensable for a deep comprehension of AI algorithms and financial models.[1, 2] The approach prioritizes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-neutral-700">
                    <li><strong>Foundational Mathematics:</strong> Commencing with Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Statistics, as these are integral to understanding machine learning algorithms and financial mathematics.[1, 3, 4]</li>
                    <li><strong>Practical Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Progressing from fundamental machine learning concepts to deep learning architectures, with an emphasis on hands-on implementation and understanding of model mechanics.[5, 6] The learning path is designed to move from theoretical understanding to practical application using widely adopted frameworks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relevant Financial Acumen:</strong> Introducing core concepts of financial markets, investment principles, and quantitative finance, enabling the application of AI and mathematical skills to financial data and problems.[7, 8, 9]</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrated Learning & Project-Based Application:</strong> Encouraging the synthesis of knowledge from all three domains through practical exercises and culminating in a capstone project. This ensures that theoretical knowledge is translated into tangible skills.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">The progression is designed to be intensive, requiring consistent effort and dedication to cover the breadth and depth necessary for meaningful skill acquisition within the six-month timeframe.</p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-neutral-700">
                    <li><strong>Software Development Experience:</strong> Proficiency in at least one programming language is assumed, with Python being the preferred language due to its extensive libraries and widespread adoption in AI and quantitative finance.[10, 11]</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> A dedicated study time of approximately 15-20 hours per week is anticipated to effectively cover the material and complete the suggested exercises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access to Resources:</strong> Consistent access to the internet for online courses, research papers, and software tools is necessary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematical Aptitude:</strong> While advanced prior mathematical knowledge is not strictly required beyond high school mathematics [12], a willingness to engage with and learn new mathematical concepts is crucial.</li>
